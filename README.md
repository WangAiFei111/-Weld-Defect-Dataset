# -Weld-Defect-Dataset

The self-built pipeline weld seam surface defect dataset consists of a total of 2,422 weld images, primarily including six types of weld categories: weld bead, incomplete welding, improperly sized weld, crater, surface pores, and normal welds. The labelme tool was used to annotate weld defects in the images, with label categories as follows: good, surface_pores, wrong_size, crater, weld, and not_fully_soldered. According to the annotation results, the dataset contains 1,365 samples of defective welds and 1,057 samples of normal welds.
